# OxyRem

## ðŸš€ Overview
**OxyRem** is a **wearable health-monitoring device** designed to track **blood oxygen levels (SpOâ‚‚) and heart rate**, ensuring real-time health insights for users. Built using **Rust for embedded systems**, OxyRem prioritizes efficiency, reliability, and an offline-first approach to ensure uninterrupted data logging. The project aims to address the increasing demand for **accessible, real-time health monitoring**, particularly for individuals with respiratory issues, athletes, and elderly users.

## ðŸ©º The Problem
Millions of people worldwide suffer from conditions that require **continuous monitoring of blood oxygen levels and heart rate**â€”such as **COPD, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular diseases**. Existing solutions often fall short due to:
- **High cost** of medical-grade devices.
- **Short battery life** in consumer wearables due to inefficient software.
- **Limited offline functionality**, requiring a constant internet connection.
- **Lack of customizable features** for different user needs.

OxyRem tackles these issues by providing a **power-efficient, offline-first wearable** that can store and transmit data **only when needed**â€”reducing power consumption while ensuring vital data is accessible when required.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- **Monitor Heart Rate & SpOâ‚‚** â€“ Continuous tracking with real-time updates.
- **Data Logging & Backup** â€“ Saves data offline and syncs when Wi-Fi is available.
- **Alerts & Warnings** â€“ Detects abnormal vitals and notifies the user.
- **(In Evaluation) GPS Tracking & Fall Detection** â€“ Potential future features for expanded health monitoring.

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain
- ESP32 development environment
- Python 3.x (for optional debugging tools)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OxyRem.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd OxyRem
   ```
3. Build and flash firmware:
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

## ðŸ“– Usage
Once installed, the device automatically starts monitoring SpOâ‚‚ and heart rate. Data is logged every **30s to 5 minutes** (configurable) and stored locally. When connected to a **trusted Wi-Fi**, logs are uploaded to the server or sent via **Telegram notifications** (if enabled). The device UI displays live vitals on an **OLED screen**.
